# Masa Improvement Proposals (MIPs)

Welcome to the Masa Improvement Proposals (MIPs) repository. This is the central hub for proposing, discussing, and collaborating on enhancements to the Masa protocol.

## Purpose of MIPs

MIPs are documents designed to introduce new features, processes, or changes to the Masa protocol. They provide a structured approach for the community to contribute ideas and for the project to evolve transparently.

## Submitting New MIPs

To submit a new MIP:

1. **Clone** this repository.
2. **Create** a new branch for your MIP.
3. **Draft** your proposal using the [MIP template](MIP/mip_template.md).
4. **Naming Convention**: `mip-<number>-<title>-<author>`
5. **Open** a pull request or submit an issue with your draft in the [DRAFT MIPs folder](MIP/draft).

Ensure your proposal is clear, concise, and follows the formatting guidelines.

## Commenting on Draft MIPs

Community feedback is essential. To comment on a draft MIP:

- Navigate to the MIP's pull request or issue.
- Provide constructive feedback and engage in discussions.

Please be respectful and keep conversations relevant to the proposal.

## Guidelines for Contributions

- **Be Respectful**: Maintain a positive and inclusive community.
- **Stay On Topic**: Focus on the proposal at hand.
- **Provide Evidence**: Support your suggestions with clear reasoning or data.
- **Follow Formatting**: Use the prescribed structure for consistency.

## MIP Lifecycle and Statuses

MIPs progress through several stages:

- **Draft**: Initial submission, open for feedback.
- **Review**: Undergoing detailed examination.
- **Accepted**: Approved for implementation.
- **Rejected**: Not proceeding further.
- **Withdrawn**: Removed by the author.

## Formatting and Structure

All MIPs should include:

- **Abstract**: A brief summary of the proposal.
- **Motivation**: The problem being solved.
- **Specification**: Detailed description of the proposed changes.
- **Rationale**: Justification for design decisions.
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Impact on existing deployments.
- **Test Cases**: Examples to illustrate the proposal.
- **Implementation**: (Optional) Links to prototype or code samples.

Use markdown for formatting and adhere to the [MIP template](link-to-template).

## Governance Process

Acceptance of MIPs is determined by:

- **Community Consensus**: Majority support from participants.
- **Technical Merit**: Feasibility and alignment with project goals.
- **Impact Assessment**: Evaluation of benefits versus risks.

Final decisions are documented and communicated transparently.
