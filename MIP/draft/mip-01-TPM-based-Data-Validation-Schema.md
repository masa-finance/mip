## Preamble
- **MIP Number**: 01
- **Title**: TPM-based Data Validation Schema for Decentralized Network
- **Author(s)**: @teslashibe
- **Type**: Standards Track
- **Status**: Draft
- **Created**: October 3, 2024
- **Version**: 1.0

## Summary

This proposal outlines the implementation of a Trusted Platform Module (TPM)-based data validation schema to enhance data integrity, incentivize honest behavior, and penalize cheating in our decentralized network. The proposed solutions include hotkey blacklisting, enhanced URL validation, miner (worker) signing mechanisms, staking contracts with slashing, TPM-signed code, periodic spot-check challenges, and TPM-based attestation for miner (worker) software integrity.

## Motivation

The decentralized network currently faces several security and integrity challenges:

- **Fake or spoofed data**: Miners (workers) may submit fake or spoofed tweets, undermining data reliability.
- **Non-responsive miners (workers)**: Some miners (workers) do not return data for queries, disrupting network operations.
- **Replay attacks**: Miners (workers) may send duplicate tweets, violating the uniqueness requirement.
- **Software integrity verification**: Difficulty in verifying that miners (workers) are running authentic and unmodified software.
- **Economic imbalance**: The current system may inadvertently favor dishonest miners (workers), leading to increased malicious activity over time.

These issues compromise the reliability of data and erode trust in the network. There's a critical need to implement robust mechanisms that ensure data integrity, verify miner (worker) honesty, and enforce penalties for dishonest behavior.

## Specification

The implementation will be carried out in phases, each introducing solutions of increasing complexity and security assurance.

### Phase 1: Foundation

#### 1. Implement Hotkey Blacklisting System

- **Blacklist Database**: Develop a database to store blacklisted miner (worker) hotkeys.
- **API Endpoints**: Create APIs for adding, removing, and querying hotkeys from the blacklist.
- **Integration**: Incorporate blacklist checks during miner (worker) registration and data submission processes.
- **Criteria Definition**: Define clear criteria for blacklisting miners (workers), such as submitting invalid data.

#### 2. Enhance Twitter URL Validation

- **Validators Verification**: Implement a system where validators verify tweets using permanent Twitter URLs returned in miner (worker) responses.
- **API Development**: Create APIs for validators to check tweet validity against Twitter's public API without requiring login credentials.
- **Real-time Validation**: Ensure that tweets are verified in real-time to prevent the acceptance of fake data.

#### 3. Implement Miner (Worker) Signing Mechanism

- **Cryptographic Handshake Protocol**: Design a protocol where miners (workers) sign submitted data with the private key used to stake MASA in an Ethereum-based smart contract.
- **Challenge-Response Mechanism**: Introduce a mechanism where validators verify the miner (worker)'s stake and signature upon data submission.
- **Public Key Infrastructure**: Modify the data submission process to include signatures and develop a system for signature verification.

#### 4. Set Up Staking Contract with Slashing Mechanism

- **Smart Contract Development**: Implement an Ethereum smart contract for handling staking and automatic slashing.
- **Stake Verification**: Develop a system to verify miner (worker) staking status during interactions.
- **Slashing Conditions**: Define conditions under which stake slashing occurs, such as failed spot-checks or confirmed cheating.

### Phase 2: Enhanced Security

#### 1. Develop TPM-Signed Code System

- **TPM Integration**: Research and integrate appropriate TPM libraries and APIs into the miner (worker) software.
- **Code Signing Process**: Implement a process where the miner (worker) software is signed using TPM, ensuring software authenticity.
- **Verification System**: Develop a system to verify TPM signatures during miner (worker) startup and periodically during operation.

#### 2. Implement Periodic Spot-Check Challenges

- **Challenge Design**: Create a variety of challenge types to verify miner (worker) behavior and data authenticity.
- **Scheduling System**: Develop a system to schedule random spot-checks for miners (workers).
- **Response Verification**: Implement logic to verify responses to spot-check challenges.
- **Scoring System**: Create a scoring mechanism based on spot-check performance to incentivize honest behavior.

### Phase 3: Advanced Ecosystem

#### 1. Develop TPM-based Attestation for Miner (Worker) Software Integrity

- **Remote Attestation Protocol**: Implement a remote attestation protocol using TPM to verify the integrity of miner (worker) software.
- **Server-side Verification**: Develop server-side systems to verify attestation reports from miners (workers).
- **Periodic Verification**: Integrate attestation checks into regular miner (worker) verification processes.

#### 2. Fine-tune Machine Learning Model for Fake Data Detection

- **Dataset Collection**: Collect and label datasets of genuine and fake tweets.
- **Model Training**: Train and optimize a machine learning model to detect fake data submissions.
- **Integration**: Implement the model into the data validation pipeline.
- **False Positives Handling**: Develop strategies to manage potential false positives to avoid penalizing honest miners (workers).

#### 3. Implement Graduated Spot-Check System

- **Dynamic Adjustment Algorithm**: Design an algorithm that adjusts spot-check frequency based on miner (worker) behavior and history.
- **Tracking System**: Implement a system to monitor miner (worker) performance over time.
- **Monitoring Dashboard**: Develop a dashboard for real-time monitoring of spot-check statistics and miner (worker) compliance.

#### 4. Create Economic Model with Staked MASA

- **Tokenomics Design**: Design an economic model that ties MASA staking to miner (worker) reputation and rewards.
- **Smart Contract Implementation**: Develop smart contracts for MASA staking, reward distribution, and slashing mechanisms.
- **Simulation and Testing**: Conduct simulations to test and refine economic incentives, ensuring they effectively promote honest behavior.

## Rationale

Implementing a TPM-based data validation schema addresses multiple security concerns by leveraging hardware-based security features. TPM and TEE provide robust mechanisms for verifying software integrity and ensuring that miners (workers) are running authenticated code. The phased approach allows for gradual implementation, balancing complexity and resource allocation.

- **Hotkey Blacklisting and Enhanced Validation**: Immediate measures to deter obvious malicious activities.
- **Signing Mechanisms and Staking Contracts**: Introduce cryptographic and economic incentives for honesty.
- **TPM Integration**: Provides a hardware root of trust, significantly increasing security.
- **Spot-Checks and Machine Learning**: Combine technical verification with behavioral analysis to detect and penalize dishonest behavior.
- **Economic Model**: Aligns miner (worker) incentives with network integrity, ensuring long-term sustainability.

## Backwards Compatibility

The proposed changes will require updates to the miner (worker) software and validation protocols. Miners (workers) will need to update their software to participate in the new validation schema. Existing miners (workers) may need to undergo a migration process to comply with the new staking and attestation requirements. Careful planning and communication will be necessary to minimize disruptions.

## Test Cases

### Example 1: Miner (Worker) Registration with Blacklisted Hotkey

- **Scenario**: A miner (worker) attempts to register using a hotkey that is on the blacklist.
- **Expected Outcome**: The registration is rejected, and the miner (worker) is notified of the blacklist status.

### Example 2: Tweet Validation

- **Scenario**: A miner (worker) submits a tweet URL that is invalid or does not exist.
- **Expected Outcome**: Validators check the URL using the public Twitter API, detect the invalidity, and the miner (worker) is penalized according to the defined policies.

### Example 3: TPM Signature Verification

- **Scenario**: A miner (worker) submits data with a TPM signature that does not match the known-good measurement.
- **Expected Outcome**: The system detects the mismatch, flags the miner (worker) for potential cheating, and initiates penalties.

### Example 4: Spot-Check Challenge Failure

- **Scenario**: A miner (worker) fails to respond correctly to a spot-check challenge.
- **Expected Outcome**: The miner (worker)'s score decreases, and if the score falls below a threshold, slashing of staked MASA is triggered.
